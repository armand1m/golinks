# golinks

This application is deployed at https://go.d1m.dev

This is an implementation of Go Links powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) through [PostGraphile](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/) and [Auth0](https://www.auth0.com).

In short, Go Links are a type of URL Shorteners. You can create an alias that points to an URL and will redirect the user to that URL.

Please check the [Related](#related) section to have a glance on how other companies and universities leverage go links.

## Deploying

A Docker Image is available at Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/armand1m/golinks

## Deploying to Kubernetes (GKE + Cloud SQL)

> Make sure to change the manifests accordingly to your environment.

Check the `./kubernetes` folder for k8s manifests content.
These manifests deploy the application together with a `cloud_sql_proxy` sidecar to allow networking with Google Cloud SQL.

Create a secret to keep the connection string:

```sh
kubectl create secret generic golinks-database \
  --from-literal=connectionstring='postgres://<user>:<pass>@<host>:5432/golinks'
```

Create a secret to keep the Cloud SQL service account:

```sh
kubectl create secret generic cloudsql-service-account \
  --from-file=service-account.json=./service-account.json
```

Create a secret to keep Auth0 ids and secrets:

```sh
kubectl create secret generic auth0-properties \
  --from-literal=client_id='auth0-app-client-id' \
  --from-literal=client_secret='auth0-app-client-secret' \
  --from-literal=cookie_secret='random-cookie-secret'
```

Create a deployment and service:

```sh
kubectl apply -f ./kubernetes/deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f ./kubernetes/service.yaml
```

### Istio

> Make sure to change the manifests accordingly to your environment.

Create the virtual service and destination rules:

```sh
kubectl apply -f ./kubernetes/istio/virtual-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f ./kubernetes/istio/destination-rule.yaml
```

## Authentication

This app leverages [Auth0](https://auth0.com) as an Identity provider. Auth0 is used to manage users and their permissions to access and modify data in this application.

### Configuring Auth0

> In the future, these steps will be automated through the Auth0 Provider for Terraform.

**Create a Regular Web Application:**

It's important that it is a Regular Web Application since this is a Next.js app. It also relies on the `accessToken` being a JWT token, so the server can extract roles and permissions from Auth0.

**Setup callback and logout urls:**

Setup the callback and logout url's to redirect to your domain + the route.

E.g.: 

Callback URL: `http://localhost:3000/api/callback`
Post Logout Redirect URL: `http://localhost:3000`

Keep the `audience`, `domain`, `client_id` and `client_secret` for easy access, as you'll need these to spin up the server (both in development and production)

**Create the following roles and permissions**:

I'm using YAML here to give a better representation of how the permissions should be setup in Auth0 roles:

```yaml
role: editor
permissions:
- create:golinks
- update:golinks
- delete:golinks
```

```yaml
role: viewer
permissions:
- read:golinks
```

These roles are used by Postgraphile when setting up a transaction for a query in a specific request context. This allows us to leverage Row Level Security through Postgres Policies to avoid access to data in the source of truth.

These roles are also used in the frontend to avoid rendering features for the user.

**Create an user and assign roles:**

Create an user and assign both the `editor` and `viewer` roles so you have access to all features.

## Developing

`armand1m/golinks` is a Next.js app using GraphQL.

The database must be a [Postgres 12.x](http://postgresql.org/) database as the GraphQL API is generated using [Postgraphile](https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/) and leverages features like Row Level Security only available from Postgres 9.6+.

PostGraphile is then used as a NPM module and served through Next.js routes itself, so you don't have to worry about CORS, and the API is initialized together with the Next.js application.

GraphQL Type definitions are generated on application startup during development, so make sure your database executed the initialization scripts during startup as PostGraphile will infer them to the generate the `type-defs.graphqls` file. (This brings some caveats when making breaking changes in the database schema during development time, but easy to overcome.)

`graphql-let` then is used to generate type definitions in Typescript for development use.

### Local Database with watch mode:

For development, we use the official `postgres` docker image. This image comes with a feature that initializes the database when provided a folder with scripts.
When started without a volume setup, the image will execute all the `.sql` scripts in the `./database` folder.

Start the database:

```sh
docker-compose up -d db
```

Prepare the project and run in development mode:

```sh
yarn
yarn dev
```

Access http://localhost:3000 and you should have a live development environment running.

### Locally, with docker and local db:

```sh
cat > ./.env.local <<EOL
DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING=postgres://dev:dev@db:5432/golinks
DATABASE_SCHEMA=public
NODE_ENV=production
AUTH0_DOMAIN=<auth0-domain>
AUTH0_AUDIENCE=<auth0-audience>
AUTH0_CLIENT_ID=<auth0-client-id>
AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET=<auth0-client-secret>
AUTH0_COOKIE_SECRET=<auth0-cookie-secret>
AUTH0_COOKIE_DOMAIN=localhost
AUTH0_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/callback
AUTH0_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000
EOL

docker-compose up
```

Access http://localhost:3000

### Locally, with docker and cloud sql db:

```sh
# Environment Variables for the Application
cat > ./.env.cloud <<EOL

AUTH0_COOKIE_DOMAIN=localhost
AUTH0_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000/api/callback
AUTH0_POST_LOGOUT_REDIRECT_URL=http://localhost:3000
EOL
